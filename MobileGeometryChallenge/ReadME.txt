---------------------------------------------------------- DESCRIPTION -----------------------------------------------------------

This application is my first mobile game with the unity software.
It was realised before my last internship in Unity and so without all my computational skills.
The goal is to finish each level before the maximum time is exceeded.


--------------------------------------------------------- USAGE ----------------------------------------------------------

To run the aplication, go into the Build folder and recover the apk file.
Put the apk file in your mobile in order to use it.
Lunch the application and try to finish all levels.
