---------------------------------------------------------- DESCRIPTION -----------------------------------------------------------

This application is my first computer game with the unity software.
It was realised thanks to the unity tutorial.
The goal is to pick up the 12 items as quickly as possible with the help of keyboard arrows to move the ball.
Challenge your friends by achieving the best time and keeping in mind it.

----------------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT ------------------------------------------------------------

The executable is available on this folder.
So have fun to play at this game and ask question if you have it.
